I'm Misa, backend developer and smart contract auditor. I have advanced knowledge in  programming, coding and scripting but I specialize in python and web3.

I've been working on Web for the last 13 years and I like to contribute to open source.

I'm a smart contract auditor at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@0xbepresent), [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/0xbepresent), [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/profile/clk8nnlbx000oml080k0lz7iy) and a like to find bugs at [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/0xbepresent).
