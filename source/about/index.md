I'm Misa, a web developer and smart contract auditor. I have advanced knowledge in  programming, coding and scripting but I specialize in python and web3.

I've been working on Web for the last 12 years and I like to contribute to open source.

I'm a smart contract auditor at [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com) and a like to find bugs at [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/0xbepresent).
